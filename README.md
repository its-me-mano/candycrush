# Candy Crush

This project is a Candy Crush game built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Inspired by the addictive puzzle game, this Candy Crush game offers an enjoyable and interactive gaming experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Candy Crush game, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/its-me-mano/candycrush.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```
   cd candycrush
   ```

3. Install the dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. This allows you to run tests for the game components and ensure their functionality.

- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
